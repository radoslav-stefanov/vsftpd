## Variables to adjust, with examples:

### Username for FTP access
client_username=dev-ftp 
### Passive ports configuration
passive_ftp_min_port=15000 
passive_ftp_max_port=20000
### If you want SSL support, you will need to install a certificate. For faster testing I have disabled SSL by default.
ssl_ftp=no
### This should be your piblic IP address
ftp_address=192.168.10.5 # This should be your public IP address
